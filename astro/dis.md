The SFMS introduced previously is not only interesting from the perfect log-linear correlation
between the star formed in different epoch.
The scatter across the correlation, i.e., 
the distribution of specific Star-Formation Rate (SSFR), 
at fixed stellar mass, is even more interesting and inspires many studies exporing physical details of galaxy evolution

## The scatter found in high-redshift galaxies

The figure below is from a paper published in 2013
, showing the intrinsic scatter found across the SFMS at redshift z~0.7.

The intrinsic scatter is larger in higher-mass galaxies
, indicating that the evolution massive galaxies undergoes is more violent compared to their lower-mass counterparts
