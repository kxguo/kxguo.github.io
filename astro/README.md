Here is a place describing my footprint as a former Astrophysical researcher.  I try to keep the most valuable pieces of my previous work here.  Have fun!

## paper list

* [The Intrinsic Scatter Along The Main Sequence of Star-Forming Galaxies at z ~ 0.7](https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4093){:.heading.flip-title} 

--- the root topic for all of my research
, talking about the intrinsic log-linear relation between the current and past star formation in galaxies 
[(*check details*)](sfms.md)
{:.related-posts.faded}
* [The Star-Formation Main Sequence: The Dependence of Specific Star Formation Rate and Its Dispersion on Galaxy Stellar Mass](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.03585)
{:.heading.flip-title} 

--- a local-universe extention of the last paper
[(*check details*)](dis.md)

* [SDSS-IV MaNGA: The Roles of AGNs and Dynamical Processes in Star Formation Quenching in Nearby Disk Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01957){:.heading.flip-title}
