Here and in related posts
, I try to combine all my studies together to give a general picture
on how the Star-Formation Main Sequence (SFMS) is a big thing in extragalactic study :D

## The log-linear relation, both near and far

The figure below is from a paper published in 2015
, showing the intrinsic relation found between specific SFR and stellar mass
, which is acturally
, a relation derived from that between current and past star formation

Then how could things be like in high redshift?
The hard points are:

- Galaxies looked faint in past (i.e., far universe)
- How to measure the star formation rate in high redshift (i.e., far universe)?
- How to find a statistical, but still intrinsic relation in high reshift?

### Star formation indicators from infrared
Galaxies are not easy to find in high redshift as they are in the local universe.
The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of their lights are low
, compared to the average level of sky light.
When the flux from galaxies are not high enough to cover the noise
, stacking is a classic method to leverage up the SNR of a group
, giving a mean luminosity with a good confidence level.

The figure below shows how we get the average infrared flux
, from stacking infrared images for galaxies binned in different stellar mass and ultraviolet color grids

### While only average values are available...
By assuming a rational deviation
, simulations could be deployed to form a distribution from the average value

Then hooray! we get somewhat credible individual star formation rates!
The Star-formation Main Sequence is also confirmed in this high redshift (z~0.7)!
