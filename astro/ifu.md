The SFMS introduced previously is not only interesting from the perfect log-linear correlation
between the star formed in different epoch.
The scatter across the correlation, i.e., 
the distribution of specific Star-Formation Rate (SSFR), 
at fixed stellar mass, is even more interesting and inspires many studies exporing physical details of galaxy evolution

## The scatter found in high-redshift galaxies

The figure below is from a paper published in 2013
, showing the intrinsic scatter found across the SFMS at redshift z~0.7.

The intrinsic scatter is larger in higher-mass galaxies
, indicating that the evolution massive galaxies undergoes is more violent compared to their lower-mass counterparts

## The scatter confirmed in local universe

It looks a bit wierd but yes
, the SFMS relation is found earlier in local universe than in high-redshift space
, while the pattern of SSFR scatter is discovered in a counter way.

However, the reason of the scatter could almost only be found in local universe.
Because optical observation has the best balance between resolution and sensitivity when it comes to large-sample studies.

Based on optical study
, the same pattern as high redshift is confirmed.
That is, higher-mass galaxies shows wider SSFR distribution.

And the width is related with the morphology of a galaxy.
That is, bulgy galaxies perform wider distribution in SSFR than disky galaxies.
