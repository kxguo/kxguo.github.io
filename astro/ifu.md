Integral Field Units (IFU) could be the most inspiring observational instruments in optical Astrophysical fields.
Galaxies are no longer points or blurred ovals
, but highly-resolved colorful objects from the views of IFU.

Thus studies based on resolved information are possible.
Mechanisms that influence galaxy evolution could also be decomposed based on IFU observation.

## Resolved SFMS, and star formation, and AGN activities

This figure is a just a pre-stage of the study of resolved galaxy evolution
, where we select galaxies based on their location across the local SFMS.

The "red points" are galaxies we have IFU observation of.

Here we apply the stacking method again to get the average resolved pattern for galaxies chosen.
Evolution traces could be clearly found from top bottom.

## Resolved Dynamical Evolution

Not only morphology and star formation evolves across the SFMS
, dynamical features also changed alot. 

Howver, massive and bulgy galaxies are not necessarily spinning slow as we expected before.
Some of them are spinning as fast as disky galaxies
, as if they are still star forming.
